# Use the computational techniques you have studied this week to answer the following question and submit your answers as a single .py file.
# 
# 1\. Find the energy levels for the quantum harmonic osicllator using the matrix ODE methods, here $V = -\frac{1}{2}m \omega^2\,x^2$.
# 
# 2\. Plot the first three (eigen) wave functions on a graph
# 
# 3\. Show that (to a threshold accuracy) the solutions are orthogonal and find this threshold.
