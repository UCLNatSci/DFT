# # Finite Square Well Bound State
# This notebook uses the technique from the Solving the SchrÃ¶dinger Equation notebook to calculate the bound states for a finite square well. There are only a few changes to the square well solution. The potential is different, in that it has a small area which is not zero but some negative value, here $-V_0$. For our calculation to be approximately correct, we need to make sure that our entire calculation space, from $-a/2$ to $a/2$ is much larger than the well, wich is from $-b/2.$ to $b/2$. The factor 100 I choose here is probably more than needed. We also need a fairly large $N$, the number of steps in our space, so that the resulting wave function is smooth in the area of the well. You may need to be somewhat patient when evaluating the well with these settings!
